# WebLine

This project is a simple implementation of WebRTC without the use of existing WebRTC libraries for the purpose of personal learning and development. The code is yet to be cleaned up and there's still known bugs to be addressed, but feel free to give it a try [here](https://webline.boutahar.dev/)!

## Future feature roadmap

- UI refinement and improvement
- Mobile screen size support
- Screen sharing
- Improved chat box
- Username selection or regeneration
